## Introduction 
### Why explore power outages? ü§îüí≠
Don't you hate it when your power goes out in the middle of a really important
task? Just in a matter of seconds, it seems like life has grinded to a halt--no
lights, no heat, and essentially, no connection to the outside world. 

Power and electricity has been the backbone of our world and its processes ever since its
invention. When this backbone suddenly dissapears, it doesn't just incovenience
us, it disrupts entire communiites, stalls busuinesses, and even puts lives at
risk. 

Thus, it is important to understand why and how power outages are caused
to avoid them in the future!

This project will be centered around one question,

#### "What are the most notable causes and characteristics of an power outage?"

For these reasons, I will explore power outages using a dataset that describes
the major outages witnessed in the continental United States during January 2000
to July 2016. As defined by the Department of Energy, the major outages refer to
those that impacted atleast 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load
loss of atleast 300‚ÄØMW. This data can be found from Purdue University's
Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastrcutre, at
https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages

In the raw Dataframe, there are 1,534 rows and 57 columns. This translates to
1,534 reported outages which meet the critiea mentioned earlier and a mix of
qualitative and quantitative potentionally correlated variables.

Here are the columns we will particuarly focus upon.

|Column                |Description|

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning üßπüßº

1. Let's start by dropping the irrelevant columns and only keeping features we
   are interested in (in other words, columns that have correlation to these
   outages) These are: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `U.S._STATE`, `NERC.REGION`,
   `CLIMATE.REGION`, `ANOMALY.LEVEL`,`OUTAGE.START.DATE`, `OUTAGE.START.TIME`,
   `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE`, `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME`, `CAUSE.CATEGORY`,
   `OUTAGE.DURATION`, `DEMAND.LOSS.MW`, `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED`,
   `TOTAL.PRICE`, `TOTAL.SALES`, `TOTAL.CUSTOMERS`, `POPPCT_URBAN`,
   `POPDEN_URBAN`, `AREAPCT_URBAN`.
2. Next, we see that the power outage start date and time is given by
   `OUTAGE.START.DATE` and `OUTAGE.START.TIME`, but it would be preferable if
   these two columns were combined into one `pd.Timestamp` column. This goes for
   the same with `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE` and `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME`.
3. Following that, we also notice that some columns contain values of 0, which
   likely mean missing values. (i.e. `OUTAGE.DURATION` of 0 is impossible) We
   should impute these missing values, but remember that methods of imputation
   may lead to skewed or inaccurate results. For now let's replace these values
   with `np.nan`.
4. The month column are in numbers, let's change these to abbreviated month names
   for reading ease in future digrams.
5. Finally, because cities are so different (ranging in population, land area,
   amount of industrial/commercial sector) let's standardize `RES.SALES`,
   `COM.SALES`, and `IND.SALES`. This will give us insight into how
   "industrial" a city is (maybe more industrial = more power = more outages?)

Here is what a few columns of our dataframe looks like.

| MONTH   | U.S._STATE   | CAUSE.CATEGORY     | OUTAGE.START                       |   IND.SALES |
|:--------|:-------------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------|------------:|
| Jul     | Minnesota    | severe weather     | Friday, July 01, 2011 17:00:00     |   -0.308476 |
| May     | Minnesota    | intentional attack | Sunday, May 11, 2014 18:38:00      |   -0.410267 |
| Oct     | Minnesota    | severe weather     | Tuesday, October 26, 2010 20:00:00 |   -0.381646 |
| Jun     | Minnesota    | severe weather     | Tuesday, June 19, 2012 04:30:00    |   -0.362797 |
| Jul     | Minnesota    | severe weather     | Saturday, July 18, 2015 02:00:00   |   -0.459947 |

### Univariate Analysis üìä

Now that our data is cleaned up, let's explore single variables that may correlate with
power outages.

This density heatmap shows the amount of reported outages in each state. We can
see that California has the greatest amount of reported outages, but we also
notice that states with higher population have more reported outages.
(coincidence or not?)
<iframe src="assets/power_outages_choropleth.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><br />

This simple bar chart displays the number of outages per count. We can see that
severe weather dominates the distribution of causes. Weather and or
climate may be a strong factor of a cause for a power outage.
<iframe src="assets/causes_count.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>  

This line chart shows the number of outages per year. We can see a spike in 2011
which can be explained by the numerous extreme weather events such as Hurricane
Irene, the Texas Winter Storm, and a tornado outbreak.

### Bivariate Analysis üìà

It seems like we have variables that correlate with one another, let's explore
these.

First, I expected that the use of lots of electricity shoud have a positive
relationship with the duration of power outages. (i.e. more electricity sold =
more electricity used = more severe/longer power outages?) We do see a very weak
positive correlation here, meaning that these variables may not be as related as we thought.
<iframe src="assets/duration_vs_sales.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><br />

Next, we examine the relationship between the cause of a power outage and its
duration. We use duration because it can be a measure of severity. (longer
duration = higher severity). The plot shows that severe weather and fuel supply
emergency, on average, have higher durations than other causes. This might be
because weather storms last days to weeks at a time and power plants that supply
electricity may take long periods of time to repair.

### Interesting Aggregates üìã

We know that climate region definitely has some correlation with the causes of a
power outage. This table below shows a count of power outages for each cause
category for each climate region. We notice that the Northeast experiences the
most severe weather, which could correlate to extreme Winter storms.
Interestingly, we also see that the Northeast experiences the most intentional
attacks by a large margin. Again, nan values mean there were no reports of that
respective cause in that region.
